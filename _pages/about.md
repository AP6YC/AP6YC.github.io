My name is Sasha Petrenko, and I am a Ph.D of Computer Engineering at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) in Rolla, MO, USA.

My current research specialties are in Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network algorithms, deep learning, clustering, cluster validation metrics, and multi-modal lifelong machine learning for computer vision applications.
I am the creator and principal developer of two open-source `Julia` packages for [Adaptive Resonance Theory](https://github.com/AP6YC/AdaptiveResonance.jl) algorithms and [Cluster Validity Indices](https://github.com/AP6YC/ClusterValidityIndices.jl) as unsupervised learning metrics, along with a myriad of other Julia and Python tools on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AP6YC).

I have a B.S. and M.S. in Aerospace Engineering, and my previous aerospace research was in the design of nanosatellite stereoscopic vision with Missouri S&T's Nanosat research program, satellite algorithm design with Sandia National Labs, and in the study of optimal estimation algorithms for orbit determination and spacecraft navigation filters.

I have developed many more packages for machine learning and clustering in the `Julia` and `Python` programming languages; feel free to take a look at the on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AP6YC).
