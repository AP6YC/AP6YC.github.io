*SIAM 2025 Presentation Title Slide*

I went to Denver in mid May 2025 for the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) conference on Dynamical Systems, where I presented the slides attached.
Feel free to download my slides by clicking on the link in the cover slide above or through the [link here](/assets/posts/Pres_SIAM_ACIL_25.pdf).

I told a story through a series of disparate papers on ART showing that they were unified by an effort to expand the boundries of ART-based algorithms, the datasets that they can tackle, and the architectures of the models themselves, especially in the effort of combining ART and deep learning.
