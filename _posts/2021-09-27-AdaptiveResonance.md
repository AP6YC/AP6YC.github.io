[`AdaptiveResonance.jl`](https://github.com/AP6YC/AdaptiveResonance.jl) is a registered [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/AdaptiveResonance/Sm0We) package, written in [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) for Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) modules ([documentation here](https://ap6yc.github.io/AdaptiveResonance.jl/dev/)).
These algorithms are built upon a foundation of the adaptive resonance neural theory and implementations of Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter.
The contributions of the project are represented as an [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03671) in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).
