`AdaptiveResonance.jl` is a registered JuliaHub package for Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) modules.
These algorithms are built upon a foundation of the neural theory and implementations of Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter.

The contributions of the project are represented as an [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03671) in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).
